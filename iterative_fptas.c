/* iterative_fptas.c
 * I want to be able to parameterise everything, and log everything.
 * Things to parameterise:
 *  EPS
 *  The problem
 *    Profits
 *    Weights
 *    x
 *    n
 *    capacity
 *    z
 *  bounding_method (make sure it is simple to add more bounding methods)
 *  ... and importantly, the Dynamic Programming Scheme!
 *    Vasirani's, Williamson and Shmoy's, and anything else.
