# Introduction

The field of discrete optimisation (CITE) studies problems that model discrete
 decision making. 
Mixed-Intger Programming refers to a set of modelling and solving techniques for
 such discrete problems (CITE) by formulating them as Mixed-Integer Programs
 (MIPs). 
To do this, we formulate a given problem as follows:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{ll@{}ll}
\text{maximse}  & \displaystyle cx+hy &\\
\text{subject to}  & \displaystyle Ax + Gy \leq b \\
                   &x \geq 0 \text{ integral}\\
                   &y \geq 0
\end{array}
\end{equation*}

Generally, constraints on how we can optimise the objective function are linear,
 and variables can be specified to be integer or continuous. 

Optimisation problems with linear-constraints with continuous variables are
 known as Linear Programs (LPs), which are solvable in polynomial time (CITE). 
MIPs, on the other hand, are characterised by having one more more variables
 constrained to be integer, generally resulting in an NP-Hard problem. 
In this report, we consider maximisation problems whose constraints are all
 linear.

The state-of-the-art method for solving MIPs is the Branch and
 Bound approach, which uses LP relaxations to achieve *implicit enumeration* of
 the search space. 
Finding the LP relaxation of a MIP simply involves removing the integer
 constraints on our variables, and solving the resulting LP. 

Because the feasible region of continuous solutions naturally subsumes the set
 of feasible solutions for integers, we know, for optimal value for the LP
 relaxation $z_{LP}$ and true optimal value $z$, that $z \leq z_{LP}$.

This provides an upper bound in our case, which we refer to as the *dual bound*.
Given our solved relaxtion, we contrain variables to "tighten" the continuous
 feasible region closer to the maximum integer solution. 
By solving LP relaxation again for this constrained subproblem, we can see if
 an optimal integer solution can exist in with these constraints: if our dual
 bound is lower than our best known value so far, we can *prune* this subproblem
 and switch to another constrained subproblem. 
Otherwise, if this subproblem has a dual bound above our best known value, we
 continue constraining and solving the relaxation until a new feasible solution
 is found, or a further constrained subproblem of this is pruned.

This constitutes the core of the Branch and Bound approach, which we describe
 below: let $(x^i, y^i)$ be the optimal solution to linear program $LP_i$,
 $(x^*, y^*)$ denote an optimal solution, $\ubar z$ denote the lower bound on
 the optimal value and $z^*$ the optimal solution of the MIP, and let
 $\mathcal{L}$ denote the list of nodes yet to be solve (i.e. not pruned nor
 branched on)\;

While finding optimal solutions with Branch and Bound is at worst case
 exponential-time, there exist Approximation Algorithms (AAs) which can provide
 feasible solutions in polynomial-time, by sacrificing guaranteed optimality.
Instead, AAs provide a guarantee on the *quality* of the solution, within some
 factor. 


An $\alpha$-approximation is an AA that guarantees that the solution value will
 always be within a constant factor $\alpha$ of the optimal solution; i.e. for
 an approximate solution value $z_{A}$, it must be that
 $\alpha z \leq z_{A} \leq z$.
As a result, for a maximisation problem, we can analytically derive an upper
 bound on the optimal value from the lower bound guarantee on the optimal
 solution. 
In this way, we can use AAs in lieu of a LP relaxation to obtain valid dual
 bounds *a priori* on our optimal solution.
Further, if we use information from a found approximate solution, we can derive
 improved dual bounds *a posteriori* on our optimal solution.
Because we are leveraging guarantees on the optimal value, the dual bounds we
 obtain are also guaranteed to be within a level of accuracy, relative to the
 optimal value. 
This is distinct from LP relaxations, which can provide arbitrarily poor dual
 bounds.

" I would add what sort of interesting problems arise when plugging AAs into BB."- Pierre

In this project, we investigate methods of effectively using dual bounds
 provided by AAs for the 0,1 Knapsack. 
To do this, we investigate known approximation schemes and methods to construct
 high quality dual bounds from them, as well as devising branching strategies
 within its Branch and Bound.
