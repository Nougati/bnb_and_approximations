# Introduction

The field of discrete optimisation (CITE) studies problems that model discrete
 decision making. 
Mixed-Integer Programming refers to a set of modelling and solving techniques for
 such discrete problems (CITE) by formulating them as Mixed-Integer Programs
 (MIPs). 
For many problems, this approach is the most efficient known method to find a
 solution. 
The standard MIP formulation, for maximisation, is as follows:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{ll@{}ll}
\text{maximise}  & \displaystyle cx+hy &\\
\text{subject to}  & \displaystyle Ax + Gy \leq b \\
                   &x \geq 0 \text{ integral}\\
                   &y \geq 0
\end{array}
\end{equation*}

Generally, objective functions are constrained by linear inequalities, and
 variables can be specified to be integer or continuous. 

Optimisation problems with linear constraints and continuous variables are
 known as Linear Programs (LPs), which are both solvable in polynomial time
 and very efficiently in practice (CITE).
In this report, we consider maximisation problems whose constraints are all
 linear.
MIPs, on the other hand, are characterised by having one more more variables
 constrained to be integer, generally resulting in an NP-Hard problem (CITE). 
By removing the integer constraints on variables in a MIP, we obtain its
 associated LP relaxation.

The state-of-the-art method for solving MIPs leverages this relationship
 to systematically search for what are known as primal solutions that are
 feasible, using bounds to implicitly enumerate through these.

Because the feasible region of continuous solutions naturally subsumes the set
 of feasible solutions for integers, we know, for optimal value for the LP
 relaxation $z_{LP}$ and true optimal value $z$, that $z \leq z_{LP}$.

\begin{align}
  z \leq z_{LP}
\end{align}

Since $z_{LP}$ is at least as large as our optimal value, we are provided with
 an upper bound in our case, which we refer to as the *dual bound*.
Given our solved relaxation, we form a subproblem by adding constraints to our
 problem which constrain certain variables to be integer, and solve this.
By solving LP relaxation again for this constrained subproblem, we can see if
 an optimal integer solution can exist in with these constraints: if our dual
 bound is lower than our best known value so far, we can prune this subproblem
 and switch to another constrained subproblem. 
Otherwise, if this subproblem has a dual bound above our best known value, we
 continue constraining and solving the relaxation until a new feasible solution
 is found, or a further constrained subproblem of this is pruned.

**Should I note that x and y are vectors of assigned values within the objective?**

This constitutes the core of the Branch and Bound approach, which we formally
 describe below: let $(x^i, y^i)$ be the optimal solution to linear program
 $LP_i$, $(x^*, y^*)$ denote an optimal solution to the MIP; $\ubar z$ denote
 the lower bound on the optimal value and $z^*$ the optimal solution of the MIP,
 and let $\mathcal{L}$ denote the list of nodes of the Branch and Bound tree yet
 to be solved (i.e. not pruned nor branched on).

\begin{algorithm}[H]

  Add the corresponding new nodes $N_{i1}, N_{ik}$ to $\mathcal{L}$ and go to step 2.

While finding optimal solutions with Branch and Bound is in worst case
 exponential-time, for some problems there exist Approximation Algorithms (AAs)
 which can provide feasible solutions in as fast as polynomial-time, by
 sacrificing guaranteed optimality.
In such cases, AAs provide a guarantee on the *quality* of the solution, 
 within some factor. 

An $\alpha$-approximation is an AA that guarantees that the solution value will
 always be within a constant factor $\alpha < 1$ of the optimal solution; i.e. for
 an approximate solution value $z_{A}$, it must be that
 $\alpha z \leq z_{A} \leq z$.
As a result, for a maximisation problem, we can analytically derive an upper
 bound on the optimal value from the lower bound guarantee on the optimal
 solution. 
In this way, we can use AAs in lieu of an LP relaxation to obtain valid dual
 bounds on our optimal solution.
Further, if we use information from a found approximate solution, we can derive
 improved dual bounds *a posteriori* on our optimal solution.
Because we are leveraging guarantees on the optimal value, the dual bounds we
 obtain are also guaranteed to be within a level of accuracy. 
This is distinct from LP relaxations, which can provide arbitrarily poor dual
 bounds. 

When conducting a Branch and Bound with AAs, an important observation is that
 the general strategies which have contributed to the success of the
 standard Branch and Bound with LPs must be addressed. 
In particular, methods of branching and warm-starting solutions do not have a
 clear translation with respect to AAs. 
In this project, we investigate methods of effectively using dual bounds
 provided by AAs for the 0,1 Knapsack. 
To do this, we investigate known approximation schemes and methods to construct
 high quality dual bounds from them, as well as devising branching strategies
 within its Branch and Bound.
