# knapsack_dp
C Implementation of the pseudo-polynomial time dynamic programming solution to the 0,1 Knapsack as described by Vijay Vasirani

*** Work in progress ***

Will be used to generally solve the Knapsack to optimality.

Stuff that will come:
  - CSV Parser
  - Pisinger instance generator support
  - Integration into Vasirani's FPTAS for DP
  - Maybe more..?
