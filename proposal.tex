\section{Introduction}
We aim to investigate the use of approximation algorithms within a branch and bound scheme. In particular, we are focused on using approximations as a method of providing dual bounds which have a worst case bounding. 

This project is concerned with using such methods to explore new paths in general optimisation problem solving. Since such an approach is unique, we seek to explore configurations of this branch and bound with approximation which achieve efficient running times. The major points of interest for doing this include optimal branching strategies, node selection schemes, and incorporating warm starting.

Our objective is to craft an approach, using this scheme, to solve branch and bound optimisation problems quickly. If this is achieved, a new promising direction of research for optimisation researchers and approximations researchers may be revealed. Moreover, this project investigates a method with a worst-case guarantee on dual bounds, a key problem in traditional LP relaxations.

MIP solvers are used in almost every industry in real world optimisation problems, due to the ubiquity of a need for both resource minimisation (expenditure) and maximisation (turnover). A high quality MIP solver is, then, a concern of businesses and developers alike. This avenue of research, then, has potential implications reaching across industries globally.

\section{Research Context / Background}

The branch and bound strategy is a algorithm design framework for combinatorial optimisation, and has a wealth of research surrounding it. To define the strategy the reader is advised to use the description provided by \cite{BOOK:1}.

For our purposes, we will define a \textit{heuristic} as an algorithm which provides a feasible, but not necessarily optimal, solution to a problem. Heuristics allow us to trade accuracy for a faster run time, which may be undesirably large if solved to optimality.

We now define an \textit{approximation algorithm}, as a heuristic which has a worst case guarantee on the solution returned. That is, we can define strict bounds which we know the solution will reside. One can parameterise the tightness of these bounds with respect to an optimal solution, by selecting an error parameter we will refer to as $\epsilon$. In general, for a maximisation problem, the bounds on the quality of the approximate solution $z_h$, relative to optimal solution $z$, is $(1-\epsilon)\cdot z < z_h < z$.   

PUT WOSLEY HERE?!

For this discussion, we merge the concepts of approximations and branch and bound by addressing the Knapsack problem as a case study. A \textit{Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme} (FPTAS) is introduced for Knapsack in \cite{BOOK:2}, where the reader is referred to for formal definitions and proofs. A proof is outlined, showing that the scheme adheres to our definition of an approximation algorithm.



\section{Research Design}

\subsection{Methodologies}

The aim of this research is to iteratively explore methods of improving the performance of our branch and bound algorithm. 

Our main question is: \textbf{can we use approximation algorithms to compute dual bounds effectively in a branch and bound scheme for combinatorial optimisation problems?}

In particular, our research methodology is driven by systematically addressing the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item What branching, searching, and pruning strategies will improve our performance?
\item How can we exploit the concept of warm starting to evaluate bounds quicker?
\item Which problem types benefit most from the proposed approach?
\end{itemize}

As the project progresses, these questions will develop into subquestions themselves as further information is understood.

We will use automated performance logging and characterise the approaches based on this. Comparisons will be done incrementally so to emphasise the effects of any changes made to the algorithm.

\subsection{Potential Difficulties}
As is the case with any research project, there are some setbacks which should be acknowledged.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Insufficient planning
  \item Ineffective idea development
  \item Substandard adoption of secondary texts
  \item Erroneous practice in artifact development
  \item Improper styling techniques
\end{itemize}

\section{Deliverables / Outcomes}
We expect there to be a series of deliverables associated with the completion of this project. In addition to this proposal, we will provide a literature review, an interim and final presentation, and a final thesis. Moreover, as is expected with design science research approaches, we aim to have publicly available artifacts for each point in the research, hosted online. It is hoped that the mechanisms will be available as a library that can be used.
