Copy all tests
 From the start of the copied section
  Change each knapPI_50 -> knapPI_200
  8061,(end)s/knapPI_50/knapPI_200/g

  and then correlated_50 -> correlated_200
  8061,(end)s/correlated_50/correlated_200/g

  Change each knapPI_100 -> knapPI_500
  8061,(end)s/knapPI_100/knapPI_500/g

  and then correlated_100 -> correlated_500
  8061,(end)s/correlated_100/correlated_500/g

_BIG TODO FOR NEXT TEST SUITE_
We have 1,2,3 w/ 50, 100, 200, 500
For night time test suite:
Copy all 1's
 in all copied 1's
  50->1000
  100->2000
  200->5000
  500->10000
then for 2, 3's

then I need to copy all the tests
then for that new slice
 1->4
 2->5
 3->6
 
copy and paste just one for these
 1->9

then for 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16
the only have different n's for c=1000
so for one of them well create the template
then copy and replace a heap of them
